"""
For a controller to be found and imported by CartPoleGUI/DataGenerator it must:
1. Be in Controller folder
2. Have a name starting with "controller_"
3. The name of the controller class must be the same as the name of the file.
4. It must have __init__ and step methods

We recommend you derive it from the provided template.
See the provided examples of controllers to gain more insight.
