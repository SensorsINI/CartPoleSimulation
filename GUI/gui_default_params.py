Possible choices for CartPole controller:

'manual-stabilization' -> GUI slider sets directly motor power
'lqr' -> linear-quadratic regulator (LQR)
'do-mpc' -> we provide do-mpc library with true equations, it internally integrates it with cvodes
'do-mpc-discrete' -> we provide do-mpc library with function returning the next state with single step eurler stepping
'rnn-as-mpc-pytorch' -> RNN trained to mimic the MPC controller, RNN implemented in Pytorch
'rnn-as-mpc-tf' -> like above, just different RNN implemented in TensorFlow
'custom-mpc-scipy' -> we optimize the cost function by calling scipy.optimize.minimize()
'mpc-opti' -> mpc implementation based on casadi opti library
