"""
This was the file to package SI_Toolkit and consequently to be able to install it with PIP.
The motivation was to easier imports between SI_Toolkit, SI_Toolkit application specific files and rest of projects where it is used
We abandoned the idea because it would not, or not necessarily be a sub-git-project
and this could once again cause that different versions of SI_Toolkit would start to diverge.
